# Animated Expansion of the Binomial Formula Using Manim

This project demonstrates the step-by-step expansion of the binomial formula \((a + b)^2\) using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), a powerful mathematical animation engine.

## Prerequisites

Before running the animations, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Manim requires Python 3.7 or higher. You can download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

- **Manim**: Install the community-maintained version of Manim by following the instructions in the [Manim Community Installation Guide](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html).

- **LaTeX**: Manim uses LaTeX for rendering mathematical expressions. Ensure that a LaTeX distribution (such as [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)) is installed and properly configured on your system.

## Project Structure

The project contains three scenes, each illustrating a different aspect of the binomial expansion:

1. **Scene1**: Introduces the binomial expression \((a + b)^2\) and transitions to its expanded form \(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\), with each term highlighted in different colors for clarity.

2. **Scene2**: Focuses on the expansion of the \(b^2\) term, breaking it down into \(b \times b\) and highlighting the components.

3. **Scene3**: Explores the \(2ab\) term, expanding it into \(2 \times a \times b\) and emphasizing each part to aid understanding.

## Running the Animations

To render the scenes, use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
manim -pql script_name.py Scene1
manim -pql script_name.py Scene2
manim -pql script_name.py Scene3
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script containing the scenes. The flags `-pql` stand for:

- `-p`: Preview the animation after rendering.

- `-q`: Set the quality of the output (l for low, m for medium, h for high).

- `-l`: Specifies the low quality setting for faster rendering during development.

For more detailed information on running and configuring Manim, refer to the [Manim Documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/).

## Customization

Feel free to modify the scenes to better suit your learning or presentation needs. Manim's flexibility allows for extensive customization of animations, including changing colors, adjusting timings, and adding more complex mathematical expressions.
